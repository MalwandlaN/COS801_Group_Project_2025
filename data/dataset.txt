A O

The O

a O
variety O
of O

there O
is O

the O
accident O
, O
it O
was O
easier O
to O
accept O
the O
industry O
potential O
risks O
, O
because O
nuclear O
power O
plants O
had O
kept O
many O
coal O
and O
gas O
plants O
from O
spewing O
air O
pollutants O
and O
greenhouse O
gases O
into O
the O
air O
. O

Afterward O
, O
the O
falling O
cost O
of O
renewable O
power O
changed O
the O
calculus O
. O

Despite O
working O
in O
the O
industry O
for O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
, O
I O
now O
believe O
that O
nuclear O
power O
benefits O
are O
no O
longer O
enough O
to O
risk O
the O
welfare O
of O
people O
living O
near O
these O
plants O
. O

I O
became O
so O
convinced O
years O
after O
departing O
office O
that O
I ve O
now O
made O
alternative-energy O
development O
my O
new O
career O
, O
leaving O
nuclear O
power O
behind O
. O

The O
current O
and O
potential O
costs O
” O
personal O
and O
economic O
” O
are O
just O
too O
high O
. O

Nuclear O
plants O
generate O
power O
through O
fission O
, O
the O
separation O
of O
one O
large O
atom O
into O
two O
or O
more O
smaller O
ones O
. O

This O
atomic O
engine O
yields O
none O
of O
the O
air O
pollutants O
produced O
by O
the O
combustion O
of O
carbon-based O
fuels O
. O

Over O
the O
decades O
since O
its O
inception O
in O
the O
1950 B-Date
s O
, O
nuclear O
power O
has O
prevented O
hundreds O
of O
fossil-fuel O
plants O
from O
being O
built O
, O
meaning O
fewer B-AffectedPopulation
people I-AffectedPopulation
have I-AffectedPopulation
suffered I-AffectedPopulation
or I-AffectedPopulation
died I-AffectedPopulation
from I-AffectedPopulation
diseases I-AffectedPopulation
caused I-AffectedPopulation
by I-AffectedPopulation
their I-AffectedPopulation
emissions I-AffectedPopulation
. O

But O
fission O
reactors O
have O
a O
dark O
side O
, O
too: O
If O
the O
energy O
they O
produce O
is O
not O
closely O
controlled O
, O
they O
can O
fail O
in O
catastrophic O
ways O
that O
kill O
people O
and O
render O
large O
tracts O
of O
land O
uninhabitable O
. O

Nuclear O
power O
is O
also O
the O
path O
to O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O
themselves O
an O
existential O
threat O
. O

As O
the O
certainty O
of O
climate O
change O
grew O
clearer O
, O
nuclear O
power O
presented O
a O
dilemma O
for O
environmentalists: O
Was O
the O
risk O
of O
accidents O
or O
further O
spread O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
greater O
than O
the O
hazard O
of O
climate O
change O
? O
In O
the O
late O
2000 B-Date
s O
, O
the O
arguments O
in O
support O
of O
nuclear O
power O
were O
gaining O
traction O
with O
Congress O
, O
academia O
and O
even O
some O
environmentalists O
, O
as O
the O
Chernobyl O
accident O
faded O
into O
the O
past O
and O
the O
effects O
of O
climate O
change O
became O
harder O
to O
ignore O
. O

No O
new O
plants O
had O
been O
proposed O
in O
decades O
, O
because O
of O
the O
industry O
dismal O
record O
of O
construction O
oversight O
and O
cost O

, O
but O
now O

But O
the O

reversed O
that O
momentum O

A O
massive O
release O
of O

from O
that O
plant O
, O
as O
its O
four O
reactors O
failed O
, O
lasted O
for O
months O
. O

The O
world O
watched O
as O
hydrogen O
explosions O
sent O
huge O
chunks O
of O
concrete O
into O
the O

” O
a O
reminder O
that O
radiation O
was O
streaming O

from O
the O
reactor O
core O
. O

More O
than O
100 O
, O

people O
were O
evacuated O
from O
their O
homes O

their O
communities O
. O

Most O
have O
not O
returned O

because O
only O
select O
areas O
have O
been O
remediated O
, O
making O
the O

seem O
like O
a O
giant O
chessboard O
with O
hazardous O
areas O
next O
to O
safer O
ones O
. O

The O
crisis O
hobbled O
the O
Japanese O
economy O
for O
years O
. O

The O
government O
estimated O
that O
the O
accident O
would O
cost O
at O
least O
$ O
180 O
billion O
. O

Independent O
estimates O
suggest O
that O
the O
cost O
could O
be O
three O
times O
more O
. O

There O
were O
obvious O
ramifications O
for O
the O
entire O
industry: O
Could O
what O
happened O
in O
Japan B-Location
happen O
elsewhere O
? O
This O
accident O
consumed O
my O
work O
at O
the O
NRC O
for O
the O
next O
six O
months O
. O

I O
assured O
the O
public O
of O
the O
safety O
of O
U B-Location
. I-Location

S I-Location

I O
did O
not O

a O
legal O
basis O
at O
that O
point O

But O
I O
also O
promised O
to O
thoroughly O
review O
the O

measures O
we O
had O
in O
place O
and O
to O
swiftly O
implement O
any O
necessary O

the O
agency O
identified O
. O

Agency O

soon O
produced O
a O
reasonable O
set O
of O

improvements O
that O
would O
reduce O
the O
chance O
of O
a O
similar O
accident O
here O
. O

The O
staff O
found O
weaknesses O
in O
the O
programs O
for O
dealing O
with O
fires B-Fire
, O

” O
the O
kinds O
of O
natural O
disasters O
that O
could O
trigger O
a O
catastrophe O
like O
Fukushima O

Yet O
after O
the O
disaster O
, O
my O
fellow O
commissioners O
, O
as O
well O
as O
many O
in O
Congress O
and O
the O
nuclear O
industry O
, O
fretted O
that O
the O
proposed O
new O
U B-Location
. I-Location

S I-Location
. I-Location

reactors O
might O
never O
be O
built O
, O
because O
Fukushima O
would O
focus O
too O
much O
attention O
on O
the O
potential O
downsides O
. O

Westinghouse O
and O
the O
new O
plant O
owners O
worried O
that O
acknowledging O
the O
need O
for O
reforms O
would O
raise O
even O
more O
concern O
about O
the O
safety O
of O
reactors O
. O

The O
industry O
wanted O
the O
NRC O
to O
say O
that O
everything O
was O
fine O
and O
nothing O
needed O
to O
change O
. O

So O
my O
colleagues O
on O
the O
commission O
and O
supporters O
of O
the O
industry O
pushed O
to O
license O
the O
first O
of O
these O
projects O
without O
delay O
and O
stonewalled O
implementation O

the O
safety O
reforms O

My O
colleagues O
objected O
to O
making O
the O
staff O
report O
public O
. O

I O
ultimately O
prevailed O
, O
but O
then O
the O
lobbying O
intensified: O
The O
industry O
almost O
immediately O
started O
pushing O
back O
on O
the O
staff O
report O
. O

They O
lobbied O
the O
commission O
and O
enlisted O
allies O
in O
Congress O
to O
disapprove O
, O
water-down O

defer O
many O
of O
the O

at O
Fukushima O
” O

over O
my O
objections O
” O
the O

implemented O
just O
a O
few O
of O
the O
modest O
safety O
reforms O

the O

problem O

people O
all O
over O

demanded O
a O
different O
approach O

Germany B-Location
closed O

shut O
down O

gets O
about O
80 O
percent O

proposed O
reducing O
that O

After O
I O
left O
the O
NRC O
in O
2012 B-Date
, O
I O
argued O
that O
we O
needed O
new O
ways O
to O
make O

impossible O
. O

When O
a O
reactor O
incident O
occurs O
, O
the O
plant O
should O
not O
release O
any O
harmful O
radiation O
outside O
the O
plant O
itself O
. O

I O
was O
not O
yet O
antinuclear O
, O
just O
pro-public-safety O
. O

But O
nuclear O
proponents O
still O
see O
this O
as O
antinuclear O
. O

They O
knew O
, O
as O
I O
did O
, O
that O
most O
plants O
operating O
today O
do O
not O
meet O
the O
no O
off-site O
release O
test O
. O

I O
think O
a O
reasonable O
standard O
for O
any O
source O
of O
electricity O
should O
be O
that O
it O
doesn t O
contaminate O
your O
community O
for O
decades O
. O

Coal O
and O
natural O

do O
not O
create O
this O
kind O
of O
acute O
accident O
hazard O
, O
though O
they O
do O
present O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
danger O
. O

Large O
dams O
for O

could O
require O
evacuation O

if O
they O
failed O
” O
but O
without O
the O
lasting O
contamination O

pose O
no O

at O
all O
. O

For O
years O
, O
my O
concerns O
about O

and O
safety O
were O
always O
tempered O
by O
a O
growing O
fear O
of O

But O
Fukushima O
provided O
a O
good O
test O
of O
just O
how O
important O
nuclear O
power O
was O
to O
slowing O
climate O

In O
the O
months O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
all O
nuclear O

were O
shuttered O
indefinitely O

eliminating O
production O
of O
almost O
all O

carbon-free O

about O
30 O
percent O
of O
its O
total O

Naturally O
, O
carbon O
emissions O
rose O
, O
and O
future O

Would O
shutting O
down O

lead O
to O
similar O
results O
? O
Eight O
years O

How O
? O
Japan B-Location
has O
made O
significant O

why O

, O

it O

not O

otherwise O

aware O

When O
I O

I O
got O
my O
first O
flat O

I O
live O
in O

take O

so O
when O
you O
pull O
off O
to O
the O
side O

the O
road O
, O
there O
is O
almost O
always O
a O
downward O
slope O
into O
a O
ditch O
. O

So O
I O
pull O
over O
and O
am O
plugging O
along O
taking O
the O
tire O
off O
, O
feeling O
real O
confident O
. O

I O
get O
the O
lug O
bolts O
off O
and O
need O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
them O
while O
I O
switch O
the O
tires O

So O
I O
put O
them O
on O
my O

The O
thing O
is O
the O
car's O
at O
a O
slant O
because O

ditch O
. O

So O
the O
bolts O
roll O
off O
into O
the O
ditch O
! O
And O
since O
the O
ditches O
are O
not O
mowed O
very O
often O
, O
the O
bolts O
got O
lost O

we O
would O
be O
having O
Thanksgiving O
dinner O
that O
afternoon O
. O

The O
sun O
was O
shining O
, O
and O
we O
were O
doing O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
activities O
together O
, O
so O
it O
was O
the O
perfect O
proposal O
setup O
, O
except O
for O
one O
thing O
: O
The O
ring O
was O
way O
too O
small O
. O

Because O
I O
NEEDED O
to O
get O
that O
quintessential O
'I O
' O
m O
engaged O
! O
' O
ring O
photo O
, O
I O
jammed O
it O
onto O
my O
finger O
anyway O
” O
and O
then O
realized O
that O
for O
the O
life O
of O
me O
I O
could O
not O
get O
it O
off O
. O

Soon O
my O
finger O
swelled O
up O
like O
a O
balloon O
and O
was O
bleeding O
from O
my O
attempts O
to O
get O
it O
over O
my O
knuckle O
, O
so O
it O
was O
clear O
we O
would O
need O
medical O
intervention O
( O
aka O
a O
ring O
cutterat O
the O
emergency O
room O
) O
to O
get O
this O
thing O
off O
my O
finger O
. O

So O
we O
ended O
our O
hike O
early O
and O
headed O
back O
to O
the O
car O
so O
we O
could O
go O
to O
the O
ER O
quickly O
, O
get O
it O
taken O
care O
of O
, O
and O
then O
head O
to O
my O
parents O
house O
for O
dinner O
where O
we O
would O
surprise O
them O
with O
our O
engagement O
and O
our O
ridiculous O
ring O
story O
. O

As O
we O
started O
the O
drive O
, O
I O
was O
still O
attempting O
to O
try O
to O
get O
the O
ring O
off O
with O
floss O
, O
lotion O
, O
soaking O
my O
hand O
in O
cold O
water O
” O
the O
works O
. O

And O
then O
the O
car O
broke O
down O
. O

So O
we O
were O
stranded O
, O
not O
within O
walking O
distance O
of O
the O
ER O
or O
my O
parents O
house O
, O
newly O
engaged O
, O
and O
with O
my O
finger O
basically O
about O
to O
fall O
off O
” O
AND O
bordering O
on O
being O
late O
for O
Thanksgiving O
dinner O
. O

We O
had O
to O
call O
my O
family O
and O
tell O
them O
what O
happened O
( O
so O
much O
for O
the O
surprise O
! O
) O
, O
and O
my O
dad O
had O
to O
come O
pick O
us O
up O
and O
take O
me O
to O
the O
ER O
to O
get O
the O
ring O
cut O
off O
while O
the O
car O
was O
towed O
. O

No O
, O
the O
jewelry O
store O
did O
not O
charge O
to O
have O
the O
diamond O
reset O
and O
new O
band O
, O
and O
no O
, O
my O
finger O
did O
not O
fall O
off O
. O

And O
the O
car O
recovered O
. O

So O
all's O
well O

ends O

is O

, O
said O

almost O
half O

Look O
at O
this O

in O
Phoenix B-Location

It O
' O
s O
the O
result O
of O
a O
spectacular O

For O
most O
farmers O
, O
soil O

Soils O
are O
really O
important O
for O
climate O
change O
as O
well O
because O
they O
store O
a O
lot O
of O
carbon O
. O

There's O
three O
times O
more O
carbon O
stored O
in O
soil O
than O
there O
actually O
is O
in O
the O
atmosphere O
. O

So O
you O
imagine O
if O
all O
that O
carbon O
was O
released O
from O
the O
soil O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
, O
we'd O
have O
This O
is O
the O
runaway O
climate O
change O
that O
people O
are O
concerned O
about O
. O

So O
what O
to O
do O
? O
Well O
, O
we O
know O
cows' O
burps O
are O
a O
problem O
for O
climate O
change O
, O
but O
their O
dung O
also O
helps O
put O
carbon O
back O
into O
the O
soil O
. O

So O
, O
this O
mobile O
dairy O
in O
the O
south B-Location
of I-Location
England I-Location
May O
prove O
part O
of O

. O

It O
means O
cows O
spread O
their O
dung O
across O
the O
fields O
, O
not O
leave O
it O
in O
the O
farmyard O
. O

That O
way O
nutrients O
and O
carbon O
from O
the O
pasture O
return O
to O
the O
soil O
. O

Here's O
the O
evidence O

This O

its O

, O
who O

, O
said O
: O
About O
the O
speed O
of O
burning O
“ O
I O
did O
not O
really O
expect O
a O
plane O
to O
burn O
like O
plastic O

The O
safety O
illuminators O
at O

melted O
even O
before O
the O
plane O
stopped O
. O

He O
said O
: O
In O
terms O
of O
who O
survived O
, O
it O
was O
just O
pure O
luck O
and O
not O
about O
panic O
. O

One O
breath O
of O
that O
black O
toxic O
smoke O
and O
a O
person O
would O
not O
stand O
up O
from O
his O
seat O
. O

And O
in O
the O
situation O
of O
zero O
visibility O
nobody O
would O
save O
him O
, O
he O
is O
simply O
not O
seen O
. O

There O
were O
no O
full O
face O
masks O
in O
the O
plane O
, O
or O
they O
were O
not O
found O
in O
time O
. O

He O
added O
: O
I O
was O
the O
last O
to O
get O
out O
, O
no O
- O
one O
from O
behind O
where O
I O
was O
sitting O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
quite O
understand O
why O
almost O
all O
behind O
the O
12th O
row O
are O
dead O
. O

My O
first O
idea O
, O
people O
rushed O
to O
the O
nearest O
exit O
and O
it O
was O
in O
the O
rear O
for O
them O
. O

Secondly O
, O
they O
were O
burnt O
by O
the O
fire B-Fire
coming O
from O
the O
wing O
. O

Those O
from O
closer O
rows O
did O
not O
get O
out O
because O
of O
the O
smoke O
. O

Two O
breaths O
and O
that O
was O
it O
. O

He O
said O
he O
could O
not O
hear O
instructions O
from O
the O
crew O
because O
of O
passengers O
screaming O
. O

Molchanov O
continued O
: O
One O
woman O
blocked O
the O
aisle O
, O
she O
was O
quickly O
lifted O
and O
all O
went O
out O
. O

Nobody O
pushed O
me O
at O
the O
back O
. O

The O
last O
part O
of O
my O
way O
I O
was O
crawling O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
breathe O
with O
. O

But O
my O
way O
was O
clear O
. O

He O
said O
lightning O
hit O
the O
plane O
in O
the O
minutes O
after O
take O
off O
en O
route O
to O
the O
Arctic B-Location
city O
of O
Murmansk B-Location
. O

Molchanov O
said O
: O
Was O
it O
possible O
to O
save O
more O
people O
? O
Not O
without O
special O
equipment O
. O

Describing O
his O
miraculous O
escape O
, O
he O
said O
: O
At O
first O
I O
felt O
hot O
in O
my O
upper O
body O
. O

I O
was O
walking O
bended O
, O
and O
when O
I O
realised O
I O
was O
about O
to O
faint O
I O
crawled O
. O

I O
did O
not O
get O
burns O
. O

By O
the O
moment O
I O
got O
out O
of O
my O
seat O
nothing O
was O
visible O
at O
the O
level O
of O
my O
head O
. O

It O
was O
black O
smoke O
. O

When O
I O
bent O
down O
the O
lower O
smoke O
was O
white O
. O

I O
did O
not O
see O
other O
people O
at O
all O
. O

I O
crawled O
out O
through O
the O
business O
class O
cabin O
to O
the O
area O
between O
business O
and O
the O
cockpit O
. O

I O
lost O
the O
sight O
of O
my O
wife O
, O
so O
I O
waited O
near O
the O
exit O
, O
with O
my O
back O
to O
the O
cockpit O
, O
the O
slide O
was O
to O
the O
right O
. O

The O
girl O
stewardess O
was O
next O
to O
me O
and O
one O
more O
man O
. O

We O
began O
to O
grab O
people O
emerging O
from O
the O
smoke O
. O

There O
were O
three O
of O
them O
, O
two O
men O
and O
one O
woman O
. O

A O
young O
man O
rushed O
to O
some O
boxes O
and O
then O
said O
they O
did O
not O
have O
any O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
a O
torch O
and O
pointed O
at O
the O
aisle O
. O

The O
stewardess O
and O
I O
jumped O
out O
to O
the O
right O
slide O
. O

The O
young O
man O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
steward O
Maxim O
Moisteev O
, O
22 O
, O
who O
died O
a O
hero O
trying O
to O
help O
his O
passengers O
escape O
. O

More O
shocking O
testimony O
came O
from O
Vladimir O
Evmenkov O
, O
Mayor O
of O
naval O
city O
Severomorsk O
, O
who O
was O
a O
business O
class O
passenger O
. O

Describing O
the O
moments O
when O
he O
evacuated O
the O
burning O
jet O
, O
he O
said O
: O
People O
were O
standing O
in O
the O
aisle O
. O

I O
was O
far O
not O
the O
first O
one O
to O
leave O
and O
when O
I O
stood O
up O
, O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
move O
forwards O
. O

There O
was O
a O
woman O
with O
a O
child O
in O
front O
of O
me O
, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
really O
walking O
, O
probably O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
breathing O
in O
the O
smoke O
. O

Running O
towards O
the O
exit O
would O
have O
meant O
trampling O
over O
people O
. O

So O
I O
was O
simply O
standing O
in O
the O
aisle O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Only O
when O
the O
moving O
has O
begun O
, O
I O
went O
forward O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
the O
right O
side O
door O
was O
already O
open O
and O
the O
inflatable O
slide O
was O
in O
place O
. O

The O
door O
at O
the O
left O
side O
was O
blocked O
and O
the O
stewardess O
was O
trying O
to O
open O
it O
, O
she O
managed O
by O
the O
moment O
I O
was O
standing O
next O
to O
her O
. O

The O
door O
opened O
, O
the O
slide O
rolled O
down O
and O
the O
passengers O
began O
to O
go O
down O
via O
the O
left O
door O
too O
. O

There O
is O
no O
emergency O
exit O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
SuperJet O
. O

He O
denied O
there O
was O
a O
panic O
, O
but O
said O
: O
There O
were O
screamsI O
did O
not O
feel O
any O
smoke O
. O

The O
tail O
of O
the O
plane O
was O
burning O
and O
I O
was O
in O
row O
six O
. O

I O
can O
' O
t O
say O
it O
was O
burning O
next O
to O
us O
. O

Those O
two O
women O
stewardesses O
, O
who O
opened O
the O
emergency O
exits O
, O
they O
did O
save O
us O
. O

He O
blamed O
the O
accident O
on O
the O
plane O
flying O
into O
a O
thunderstorm B-NaturalHazards
insisting O
saw O
lightning O
hit O
the O
one O
of O
the O
engines O
. O

Vladimir O
said O
: O
I O
was O
sitting O
next O
to O
the O
window O
and O
saw O
with O
my O
own O
eyes O
that O
lightning O
twice O
hit O
the O
right O
engine O
. O

There O
were O
two O
very O
loud O
pops O
and O
two O
flashes O
but O
the O
engine O
did O
not O
catch O
fire B-Fire
. O

Speaking O
about O
the O
emergency O
landing O
, O
he O
said O
: O
We O
touched O
the O
runway O
, O
we O
jumped O
up O
, O
then O
we O
went O
down O
again O
and O
jumped O
again O
, O
even O
higher O
than O
first O
time O
. O

Then O
the O
engine O
caught O
fire B-Fire
. O

After O
the O
third O
jump O
the O
wheel O
was O
broken O
, O
most O
likely O
, O
because O
we O
fell O
on O
one O
side O
, O
turned O
round O
and O
were O
sliding O
along O
the O
runway O
. O

We O
were O
sliding O
across O
the O
runway O
and O
loosing O
speed O
and O
were O
about O
to O
stop O
. O

I O
looked O
at O
the O
others O
and O
saw O
everyone O
jumped O
up O
from O
their O
seats O
. O

I O
noticed O
that O
a O
family O
from O
the O
left O
row O
“ O
a O
man O
, O
a O
woman O
and O
a O
child O
“ O
went O
on O
their O
knees O
and O
were O
crawling O
at O
the O
floor O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
that O
running O
forward O
would O
mean O
running O
over O
the O
people O
, O
so O
all O
who O
saw O
this O
were O
just O
standing O

waiting O
, O
when O
it O
would O
be O

As O
soon O

idea O

the O
risk O

the O
USGS O

The O

changing O
, O
as O
is O
the O
physical O
environment O

Both O
development O

global O
warming O
add O
uncertainty O
to O
flood B-Floods
risk O
calculations O
, O
which O
Holmes O
says O
is O
frustrating O
for O
local O
officials O
who O
want O
clear O
information O
about O
future O
flood B-Floods
probability O
so O
they O
can O
make O
decisions O
accordingly O
. O

Holmes O
says O
a O
lot O
is O
on O
the O
line O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
communicating O
flood B-Floods
risk O
. O

If O
you O
build O
in O
the O
wrong O
spot O
, O
or O
you O
buy O
a O
house O
that O
you O
were O
unaware O
that O
you O
had O
a O
risk O
, O
you O
could O

your O

we O
never O
define O
it O
that O
way O
";" O
it O
is O
our O
duty O
anyway O
. O

The O
strategy O
is O
always O
very O
simple O
, O
it O
should O
be O
zero O
casualty O
, O
if O
we O
go O
by O
the O
zero O

approach O
";" O
it O
has O
been O
very O
, O
very O
effective O
, O
because O
zero O

in O
what O
was O
12 O

0 O
in O
the O
'99 O

So O
, O
we O
reached O
a O
double O
( O
casualty O
) O
figure O
of O
30 O
, O
so O
that O
way O
I O
think O
those O
who O
have O
died O
, O
they O
died O
because O
they O
exposed O
themselves O
and O
did O
not O
listen O

the O
advisory O

made O
some O
errors O

judgment O
Those O
who O
ventured O
out O

way O
I O
will O
call O
it O

successful O

three O

We O
did O
have O
some O

the O

: O

The O
need O
to O
adapt O
May O
seem O
obvious O

shows O
that O

I O
believe O
there O
should O
be O
consistent O
standards O
for O
flood B-Floods
and O
coastal O
resilience O
in O
England B-Location
. O

To O
explore O
and O
develop O
such O
standards O
, O
the O
Environment O
Agency O
wants O
to O
work O
with O
partners O
to O
develop O
a O
national O
suite O
of O
tools O
that O
can O
be O
used O
in O
combination O
to O
deliver O
resilience O
for O
communities O
. O

This O
could O
include O
traditional O
defences O

natural O
flood B-Floods

, O
ensuring O

To O
do O
this O
, O
government O
, O
the O
Environment O
Agency O

will O
need O

, O
changes O
to O
local O
environments O
, O
and O
the O
latest O
climate O
science O
. O

The O
government O
demonstrated O
agility O
following O
the O
IPCC O
report O
last O
year O
, O
when O
it O
commissioned O
the O
Committee O
on O
Climate O
Change O
to O
look O
at O
how O
to O
reach O
net O
zero O
. O

The O
Committee O
says O
the O
UK B-Location
can O
reach O
net O
zero O
emissions O
by O
2050 B-Date
by O
setting O
an O
ambitious O
new O
target O
. O

The O
report O
has O
been O
welcomed O
by O
government O
. O

Our O
second O
theme O
is O
growth O
and O
infrastructure O
. O

We O
must O
ensure O
that O
all O
new O
development O
is O
not O
only O
resilient O
to O
flooding B-Floods
, O
but O
contributes O
to O
environmental O
net O
gain O
. O

More O
should O
be O
done O
to O
encourage O
property O
owners O
to O
build O
back O
better O
and O
in O
better O
places O
after O
a O
flood B-Floods
, O
rather O
than O
just O
recreating O
what O
was O
there O
before O
. O

This O
could O
involve O
home O
improvements O
, O
such O
as O
raised O
electrics O
, O
hard O
flooring B-Floods
, O
and O
flood B-Floods
doors O
. O

We O
will O
work O
with O
government O
, O
insurers O
and O
financial O
institutions O
to O
review O
how O
to O
bring O
about O
this O
change O
by O
2025 B-Date
. O

- O
In O
some O
places O
, O
the O
scale O
of O
the O
threat O
May O
be O
so O
significant O
that O
recovery O
will O
not O
always O
be O
the O
best O
long O
term O
solution O
. O

In O
these O
instances O
, O
we O
will O
help O
communities O
to O
move O
out O
of O
harm O
' O

way O

- O
Presently O
, O
two O
thirds O
of O
properties O
in O
England B-Location
are O
served O
by O

We O
suggest O
that O
between O
now O
and O
2050 B-Date
, O
all O
publicly O
funded O
infrastructure O
should O
aim O
to O
be O
resilient O
to O
flooding B-Floods
and O
coastal O
change O
. O

Our O
long O
term O
ambition O
should O
be O
to O
support O
local O
economic O
regeneration O
and O
sustainable O
growth O
through O
investments O
in O
new O
flooding B-Floods
and O
coastal O
change O
projects O
. O

This O
can O
unlock O
opportunities O
for O
housing O
and O
businesses O
in O
places O
where O
repeat O
flooding B-Floods
has O
damaged O
local O
economies O
. O

There O
are O
many O
examples O
of O
this O
already O
happening O
around O

In O

protected O
over O
a O

Our O
third O
theme O
is O
: O
A O

Only O
a O
third O

risk O
areas O
believe O
their O

at O

. O

We O
need O
to O
build O
a O
nation O

understand O
their O
risk O
, O
are O

for O
it O
, O
and O
know O
how O
to O
act O
on O
it O
. O

We O
need O
to O
inspire O
people O
to O
take O
action O
before O
flooding B-Floods
hits O
. O

We O
will O
do O
this O
by O
educating O
young O
people O
about O
the O
risks O
through O
the O
school O
curriculum O
, O
by O
helping O
people O
to O
understand O
what O
action O
to O
take O
, O
and O
which O
services O
they O
can O
expect O
from O
public O

The O
water O
drawn O

The O

we O
cannot O
win O
a O
war O
against O

by O
building O
flood B-Floods
defences O
and O
instead O
has O
called O
for O
a O
new O
approach O
to O
ensure O

are O
resilient O
enough O
to O
survive O
the O
escalating O
threat O
of O
flooding B-Floods
resulting O
from O
climate O

. O

With O
global O
temperatures O
predicted O
to O
rise O
between O
2C O
and O
4C O
by O
2100 O
, O
the O
EA O
warned O
traditional O
defences O
are O
not O
enough O
to O
protect O
communities O
against O
the O
growing O
risks O
of O
flooding B-Floods
and O
coastal O
erosion O
. O

More O
than O
five O
million O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
flooding B-Floods
and O
coastal O
erosion O
and O
yet O
only O
a O
third O

living O
in O

further O
added O
at O

‚ O
£1 O

Ms O

: O
The O

never O
stayed O
in O
the O

there O
have O
always O
been O

We O
can O
' O
t O
win O
a O
war O
against O

by O
building O
away O
climate O

with O
infinitely O
high O
flood B-Floods
defences O
. O

We O
need O
to O
develop O
consistent O
standards O
for O

coastal O
resilience O
in O
England B-Location
that O
help O
communities O
better O
understand O
their O

them O
more O
control O
about O
how O
to O
adapt O

Currently O
, O
two O

of O
properties O
in O
England B-Location
are O
served O
by O
infrastructure O
in O
areas O
at O
risk O
of O
flooding B-Floods
and O
for O
every O
person O
who O
suffers O
flooding B-Floods
, O
around O
16 O
more O

affected O
by O
loss O
of O
services O
such O
as O
power O
, O
transport O
and O
telecommunications O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
scale O
of O
flooding B-Floods
or O
coastal O
change O
May O
be O
so O
significant O

Edited O
excerpts O

The O
eye O
of O
the O
storm B-NaturalHazards
passed O
through O
Puri B-Location
and O
Bhubaneswar B-Location
. O

Damage O
has O
been O
most O
extensive O
in O
areas O
of O
communication O
lines O
, O
power O
supply O
and O
water O
. O

Water O
supply O
will O
probably O
be O
fine O
in O
a O
few O
days O
. O

Telecom O
lines O
will O
also O
be O
up O
in O
a O
week O
. O

Mobile O
connectivity O
is O
partially O
restored O
. O

I O
got O
a O
sense O
that O
people O
are O
optimistic O
about O
telecom O
lines O
, O
as O
they O
are O
able O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
outside O
Bhubaneswar B-Location
. O

The O
problem O
lies O
in O
restoration O
of O
power O
lines O
. O

The O
major O
hurdles O
are O
uprooted O
trees O
, O
as O
they O
have O
power O
lines O
wrapped O
around O
them O
. O

It O
will O
take O
a O
week O
to O
10 O
days O
to O
come O
close O
to O
near O
normal O
in O
power O
supply O
. O

The O
principal O
differentiating O
point O
is O
that O
this O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
hit O
in O
peak O
summer O
. O

The O
usual O
time O
for O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
in O
Odisha B-Location
is O
October B-Date
- O
November B-Date
. O

When O
a O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
develops O
800 O
miles O
south O
of O
the O
equator O
and O
hits O
the O
coast O
of O
Odisha B-Location
, O
it O
has O
built O
into O
a O
system O
that O
is O
laden O
with O
moisture O
. O

The O
second O
is O
that O
half O
of O
the O
cyclonic B-NaturalHazards
eye O
went O
over O
land O
and O
half O
of O
it O
was O
in O
the O
sea O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
heat O
differential O
and O
being O
more O
moisture O
- O
laden O
, O
it O
hit O
harder O
. O

Thirdly O
, O
this O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
passed O
parallel O
to O
the O
coastline O
but O
covered O
half O
of O
the O
coast O
. O

It O
was O
half O
inside O
and O
half O
in O
the O
sea O
. O

If O
you O
drew O
the O
line O
, O
you O
could O
see O
that O
there O
is O
a O
bulge O
starting O
from O
south B-Location
of I-Location
Puri I-Location
near O
Chilka B-Location
. O

There O
is O
a O
bulge O
in O
land O
mass O
up O
to O
Balasore O
and O
above O
. O

These O
are O
built O
up O
and O
that O
' O
s O
why O
there O
was O
so O
much O
damage O
. O

Even O
if O
we O
had O
six O
months O
' O
advance O
warning O
, O
this O
could O
not O
have O
been O
prevented O
, O
primarily O
because O
we O
have O
not O
built O
disaster O
- O
resilient O
towns O
. O

Such O
towns O
have O
underground O
cables O
and O
wind O
directional O
hoardings O
. O

It O
would O
mean O
poles O
of O
a O
certain O
level O
which O
will O
not O
bend O
during O
a O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
. O

It O
will O
mean O
planting O
trees O
which O
will O
not O
get O
uprooted O
. O

It O
is O
time O
for O
us O
to O
think O
about O
disaster O
- O
resilient O
coastal O
cities O
. O

The O
army O
, O
navy O
and O
coast O
guard O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
operation O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
made O
clear O
that O
NDRF O
has O
to O
play O
a O
frontline O
role O
in O
disaster O
management O
. O

A O
major O
role O
of O
the O
NDRF O
is O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
prediction O
from O
the O
IMD O
and O
other O
inputs O
. O

We O
had O
pre O

positioned O
troops O
in O
all O
high O

areas O
and O
that O
' O
s O
why O
we O
could O
help O
in O
evacuation O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
role O
that O
we O
have O
taken O
and O
now O
have O
specialisation O

Dr O

They're O

which O
is O
absolutely O
fine O

But O
what O
we're O
doing O
is O
highlighting O
the O
fact O
that O
actually O
, O
if O
you O

though O
the O

it O

take O

up O

then O
we're O
getting O
a O

now O
, O
which O
seeps O

that O
causes O
really O
more O
O O

the O

itself O
, O
Livesay O

He O
adds O
that O
it O
seems O
this O
happens O
too O

It O
kind O

we're O

you O

they've O

that O
they O
can O
deal O
with O

like O
that O
. O

We O
depend O
a O

the O
State O
of O

they O
can O
only O
go O
so O
far O

help O
us O
out O
. O

We O
realize O
that O
, O
so O
we O
like O
to O
say O
there O
is O
a O
price O
to O
be O
paid O
for O
living O
in O

, O
Livesay O
explained O
. O

He O
mentions O
that O
many O
of O
the O
people O
that O
live O
in O
Grand O

call O
it O
home O
and O
if O
it O
were O
to O
flood B-Floods
, O
they O
would O
likely O
return O
. O

Livesay O
says O
he O
fears O
one O
day O
the O
levees O
May O
not O
be O
able O
to O
protect O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
the O
permanent O
fix O
would O
be O
. O

It O
would O
be O
so O
expensive O
, O
I O
doubt O
that O
we'll O
ever O
see O
that O
, O

one O
of O

we're O

It's O
just O
, O
I O

we're O
going O

see O
that O
. O

Hopefully O
not O
in O

A O
civil O

that O
desilting O

in O
the O
country O
' O

capital O
, O
Accra B-Location
is O
not O
enough O
to O
prevent O
flooding B-Floods
if O
other O
drastic O
measures O
are O
not O
taken O
to O
end O
the O
annual O
cycle O
. O

He O
made O
these O
remarks O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
Johnnie O
Hughes O
on O

According O
to O
him O
, O
even O
if O
we O
desilt O
our O
drains O
and O
kept O
our O
environment O
clean O
, O
without O
implementing O
a O
plan O
to O
re O
- O
engineer O
the O
city O
' O
s O
drainage O
system O
, O
we O
will O
still O
have O
floods B-Floods
. O

Re O
- O
engineering O
, O
he O
said O
, O
will O
ensure O
proper O
mechanization O
of O
all O
drains O
to O
efficiently O
channel O
and O
accommodate O
water O
to O
prevent O
flooding B-Floods
. O

He O
made O
reference O
to O
the O
ongoing O
project O
at O
Kaneshie O
First O
Light O
as O
an O
example O
of O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
urgently O
. O

He O
explained O
, O
we O
need O
drastic O
measures O
to O
ensure O
we O
are O
safe O
in O
Ghana B-Location
because O
Accra B-Location
by O
its O
topography O
is O
a O
low O
lying O
area O
. O

He O
observed O
that O
rainwater O
rushes O
down O
easier O
than O
it O
used O
to O
in O
the O
past O
, O
due O
to O
the O
increasing O
spate O
of O
physical O
development O
upstream O
, O
hence O
the O
increasing O
instances O
of O
flooding B-Floods
downstream O
. O

The O
engineer O
also O
suggested O
a O
change O
in O
O O
Ghana O
Location O
' O
s O
current O
housing O
regulations O
, O
to O
enforce O
a O
rule O
that O
mandates O
property O
owners O
to O
leave O
between O
15 O
- O
20 O
% O
of O
personal O
land O
spaces O
for O
greenery O
to O
allow O
for O
rainwater O
to O
easily O
run O
off O
and O
sip O
away O
into O
the O
earth O
. O

As O
an O
incentive O
for O
those O
who O
would O
leave O
larger O
spaces O
with O
the O
right O
slope O
, O
he O
recommended O
a O
cut O
in O
their O
building O
permit O
fees O
. O

He O
further O
challenged O
authorities O
to O
muster O
courage O
and O
remove O
buildings O
in O
waterways O
. O

We O
should O
be O
courageous O
to O
pull O
down O
buildings O
in O
waterways O
. O

Ing O
. O

Arthur O
added O
that O
people O
who O
often O
build O
on O
waterways O
do O
not O
feel O
the O
brunt O
of O
their O
fault O
but O
rather O
those O
downstream O
have O
had O
to O
endure O
regular O
O O
flooding O
Floods O
, O
destruction O
of O
properties O
and O
sometimes O
death O
. O

In O
some O
localities O
in O
O O
Ghana O
Location O
, O
estate O
developers O
and O
landowners O
have O
developed O
the O
habit O
of O
filling O
waterlogged O
areas O
and O
low O
- O
lying O
areas O
with O
gravel O
to O
elevate O
their O
lands O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
homeowners O
find O
it O
prestigious O
to O
cover O
all O
open O
spaces O
with O
pavement O
blocks O
or O
tiles O
. O

However O
, O
Ben O
Arthur O
admonished O
that O
having O
completely O
paved O
or O
tiled O
compounds O
is O
not O
the O
way O
to O
go O
, O
and O
doesn O
' O
t O
in O
anyway O
prove O
affluence O
. O

As O
to O
why O
these O
ideas O
are O
not O
being O
practiced O
, O
Ben O
Arthur O
said O
: O
engineers O
know O
these O
, O
but O
they O
are O
unavailable O
to O
implement O
them O
because O
of O
the O
laws O
. O

The O
engineer O
explained O
that O
strong O
legal O
backing O
could O
give O
some O
authority O
to O
engineers O
and O
local O
assemblies O
to O
enforce O
these O
standards O
. O

He O
called O
on O
Ghanaians O
to O
return O
to O
the O
culture O
of O
harvesting O
water O
when O
the O
rains O
come O
along O
, O
as O
that O
could O
also O

context O
of O
climate O
change O
, O
architect O
and O
town O

Arif O
Hasan O
said O
that O
climate O
change O
had O
motivated O
the O
government O
here O
to O
set O
up O
many O
centralised O
organisations O
such O
as O
the O
National O
Disaster O
Management O
Authority O
and O
Provincial O
Disaster O
Management O
Authorities O
. O

However O
they O
did O
not O
really O
have O
the O
capacity O
to O
deal O
with O
disaster O
situations O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
also O
mitigation O
and O
management O
issues O
regarding O
infrastructure O
and O
land O
departments O
. O

During O
the O
2010 B-Date
floods B-Floods
, O
I O
worked O
in O
areas O
where O
the O
floods B-Floods
took O
place O
and O
the O
volume O
of O
water O
in O
earlier O
floods B-Floods
was O
far O
more O
though O
the O
disaster O
was O
bigger O
in O
2010 B-Date
. O

It O
was O
because O
the O
land O
departments O
were O
not O
functioning O
well O
. O

There O
was O
no O
cleaning O
of O
canals O
, O
no O
desilting O
of O
drains O
, O
deforestation O
had O
also O
taken O
place O
with O
failure O
of O
the O
irrigation O
department O
in O
carrying O
out O
its O
normal O
functions O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Then O
between O
1983 B-Date
and O
2010 B-Date
, O
there O
had O
been O
much O
construction O
on O
the O
flood B-Floods
plains O
with O
villages O
and O
even O
schools O
there O
while O
under O
the O
law O
there O
shouldn O
' O
t O
be O
any O
settlements O
there O
. O

Then O
in O
2011 B-Date
, O
too O
, O
it O
was O
the O
same O
story O
, O
Mr O

pointed O
out O
. O

About O
the O
heat O
island O

of O
48 O
degrees O
Celsius O
and O
still O
no O
one O
had O
died O
. O

So O
what O
changed O
? O
Human O
settlements O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
these O
settlements O
changed O
. O

rises O
in O

there O

, O
he O

Dr O

Decades O

mean O
that O
Colima O
' O

well O
- O
documented O
. O

However O
, O
we O
had O
little O
knowledge O
of O
the O
frequency O
or O
magnitude O
of O

that O
took O

at O
any O

, O
when O
the O

and O
began O
written O
observations O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
, O
we O
have O
modelled O
the O
volume O

magnitude O
of O
five O

0 O
years O

Our O

still O
underestimate O
the O
volume O
of O
these O

by O
an O
order O

So O

5 O

Moving O
up O

In O

After O

, O
city O
officials O
considered O
some O
drastic O

long O

But O
as O

the O
city O
is O

He O
said O

did O
on O
the O
night O
that O

Along O
with O
the O
doubts O
about O

the O

have O
also O
been O
panned O

unsightly O
interlopers O
along O

stretch O
of O

popular O
with O

” O
one O

called O

They O
will O
cover O
only O
about O
one O

unprotected O
, O
possibly O
for O
another O
decade O

Officials O
have O
admitted O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
a O
plan O
for O
protecting O
much O
of O
the O
financial O
district O

which O
is O
home O

about O

one O
of O

city O
. O

They O
have O
concluded O
that O
Lower B-Location
Manhattan I-Location
is O
simply O
too O
congested O
, O
with O
18 O
subway O
lines O
and O
a O
tangle O
of O
utilities O
running O
beneath O
its O
warren O
of O
narrow O
streets O
, O
for O
land O
- O
based O
defenses O
like O
fences O
that O
flip O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
have O
a O
more O
ambitious O
vision O
and O
have O
begun O
planning O
to O
extend O
the O
shoreline O
of O
the O
island O
into O
the O
water O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
bulwark O
against O
rising O
sea O
levels O
and O
storm B-NaturalHazards
surges O
. O

But O
making O
more O
of O
Manhattan B-Location
will O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
financial O
district O
will O
rely O
on O
a O
combination O
of O
commercial O
products O
that O
are O
typically O
used O
as O
temporary O
protections O
against O
flooding B-Floods

come O
from O
Home O

Hesco O
barriers O

plastic O
tubes O
known O

can O
be O
filled O

sand O

and O
linked O
together O
to O
form O
a O
low O

been O
used O
to O
hold O
back O
raging O
rivers O

many O

the O

laid O
out O

The O

One O
of O
the O
reason O

' O

barge O
into O
active O
areas O
with O
very O
little O
to O
no O
warning O
, O
which O
can O
put O
everyone O
at O
great O
risk O
. O

When O
firefighters O
from O
a O
private O
agency O
are O
on O
the O
ground O
near O
a O
fire B-Fire

, O
it O
might O
prevent O
air O
drops O

for O
fear O
of O

. O

But O
calling O
off O
the O

be O
risky O
for O
the O
pilot O

He O
' O

The O
reasoning O
is O
simple O
: O
Paying O
for O
a O
private O
fire O
crew O
is O
often O
less O
expensive O
than O
rebuilding O
an O
entire O

it O
to O

down O
. O

Even O
an O

policy O
promising O
protection O
, O
though O
, O
is O
no O
guarantee O

will O
remain O
standing O
. O

One O
thing O
that O
might O
have O
helped O
the O
chaotic O
situation O
was O
a O
state O
law O
passed O
last O
summer O
” O
but O
that O
will O
not O
go O
into O
effect O
until O
later O
this O
year O
” O
that O
requires O
anyone O
appearing O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
a O
fire B-Fire
to O
check O
in O
with O
an O
incident O
commander O
, O
who O
oversees O

This O

goes O
for O

well O

not O

In O

when O

In O
London B-Location
, O
in O
the O
17th O
through O
19th O
centuries O
, O
firefighting O
was O
privatized O
, O
led O
primarily O
by O
fire O
insurance O
companies O

which O
grew O
out O
of O
the O
Great O
Fire O
in O
1666 B-Date

The O

fierce O

Gradually O
, O
the O
notion O
that O

our O

We O

One O
factor O

that O

Survivor O

the O
chaotic O

was O
clear O
that O
the O

did O
not O

all O

it O

the O
plane O

on O

have O
concluded O

simply O
too O
congested O

with O
18 O

Instead O
, O
they O
have O
a O
more O
ambitious O
vision O

have O
begun O
planning O
to O
extend O
the O
shoreline O
of O
the O

serve O
as O
a O
bulwark O
against O

storm B-NaturalHazards

. O

But O
making O
more O
of O

will O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money O
. O

In O
the O

, O
the O
financial O
district O
will O
rely O
on O
a O

three O

Forced O
to O
start O
again O
, O
he O
took O
the O
risk O
to O
grow O
the O
new O

. O

My O
wife O

I O
talked O

would O
we O
replant O

just O
call O

he O
said O

At O
the O
time O
we O
were O
doing O
quite O
well O
out O
of O
export O
, O
but O
domestic O
was O
starting O
to O
slow O
, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
into O
the O
export O
varieties O
, O
and O
it O
is O
going O
to O
pay O
off O
, O
Mr O
Roth O

Six O
years O
on O

have O
begun O
to O
mature O
, O
and O
100 O

been O
commercially O

Chair O

Citrus O

Queensland O
Regional O
Advisory O

Cris O
Bryant O
said O
the O
industry O
body O
was O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
types O
of O
mandarins O
. O

There's O
certainly O
an O
appetite O
for O
new O
varieties O
, O
we O
know O
what O
our O
customers O
want O
and O
we O
need O
to O
meet O
their O
needs O
, O
Mr O
Bryant O
said O
. O

Certainly O
in O
a O
regional O
area O
, O
in O
our O
growing O
district O
, O
we O
do O
need O
to O
try O
varieties O
that O
we O
know O
will O
work O
in O
our O
region O
. O

So O
for O
[ O
the O
Roths O
] O
to O
find O
a O
variety O
that O
we O
know O
works O
in O
this O
region O
has O
ticked O
a O
lot O
of O
boxes O
already O
because O
it's O
got O
to O
stack O
up O
commercially O
, O
and O
it's O
got O
to O
be O
reliable O
every O
year O
, O
it's O
got O
to O
have O
a O
good O
yield O
and O
quality O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Mr O
Bryant O
said O
traditionally O
up O
to O
a O
third O
of O
the O
region's O
mandarins O
were O
exported O
, O
but O
that O
sector O
was O
growing O
to O
around O
50 O
per O
cent O
. O

Domestically O
we've O
come O
through O
very O
tough O
times O
and O
things O
have O
improved O
slightly O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
that O
is O
off O
the O
back O
of O
people O
removing O
their O
domestic O
varieties O
and O
moving O
towards O
the O
more O
lucrative O
export O
markets O
, O
Mr O
Bryant O
said O
. O

The O
change O
also O
benefiting O
the O
return O
on O
domestic O
fruits O
. O

Because O
the O
supply O
of O
domestic O
varieties O
have O
dropped O
, O
they've O
lifted O
in O
price O
as O
the O
markets O
haven't O
been O
as O
cluttered O
or O
oversupplied O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Every O
second O
year O
the O
population O
of O
Queensland's O

capital O
more O

that O
, O
Ms O

said O
. O

Ms O
Slack O
said O
the O
festival O
has O
remained O
an O
important O
marketing O
tool O
for O
the O
region O
. O

You've O
got O
your O
travellers O
coming O
through O
, O
you've O
got O
your O
grey O
nomads O

travelling O
through O

they O
like O
to O
find O

sad O
when O
he O
explained O
the O
situation O
, O
but O
he O
was O
also O
calmer O
. O

The O
mania O
behind O
his O
insistence O
that O
the O
contaminated O

had O
required O
cleaning O
had O
evaporated O

relieved O

I O
understood O
his O
dilemma O
. O

He O
had O
only O
been O
the O
repeating O
official O
dogma O
because O
his O
job O
, O
and O
the O
larger O
culture O
and O
politics O
, O
required O
him O
to O
. O

Such O
has O
been O
the O
treatment O
of O
radiation O
fears O
by O
scientists O
and O
government O
officials O
, O
not O
just O
in O
Japan B-Location
, O
for O
over O
60 O
years O
. O

There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
low O
levels O
of O
radiation O
hurt O
people O
, O
but O
rather O
than O
be O
blunt O
about O
that O
, O
scientists O
have O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
shaded O
the O
truth O
often O
out O
of O
a O
misguided O
sense O
of O
erring O
on O
the O
side O
of O
caution O
, O
but O
thereby O
allowing O
widespread O
misunderstanding O
of O
radiation O
to O
persist O
. O

We O
also O
now O
know O
that O
when O
societies O
don O
' O
t O
use O
nuclear O
, O
they O
mostly O
use O
fossil O
fuels O
, O
not O
renewables O
. O

After O
Fukushima O
, O
Japan B-Location
closed O
its O
nuclear O
plants O
and O
saw O
deadly O
air O
pollution O
skyrocket O
. O

The O
biggest O
losers O
, O
as O
per O
usual O
, O
are O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
: O
those O
with O
respiratory O
diseases O
, O
such O
as O
emphysema O
and O
asthma O
, O
children O
, O
the O
elderly O
, O
the O
sick O
, O
and O
the O
poor O
, O
who O
tend O
to O
live O
in O
the O
most O
polluted O
areas O
of O
cities O
. O

It O
' O
s O
also O
clear O
that O
people O
displace O
anxieties O
about O
other O
things O
onto O
nuclear O
accidents O
. O

We O
know O
from O
in O
- O
depth O
qualitative O
research O
conducted O
in O
the O
1970 B-Date
s O
that O
young O
people O
in O
the O
early O
part O
of O
that O
decade O
were O
displacing O
fears O
of O
nuclear O
bombs O
onto O
nuclear O
plants O
. O

Nuclear O
plants O
are O
viewed O
as O
little O
bombs O
and O
nuclear O
accidents O
are O
viewed O
as O
little O
atomic O
explosions O
, O
complete O
with O
fall O
- O
out O
and O
the O
dread O
of O
contamination O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
view O
the O
Japanese B-Location
public O
' O
s O
panicked O
overreaction O
to O
Fukushima B-Location
and O
not O
see O
it O
as O
partly O
motivated O
by O
the O
horror O
of O
having O
seen O
15 O
, O
897 O
citizens O
instantly O
killed O
, O
and O
another O

, O
533 O
gone O
missing O
, O
after O
a O
tsunami O
hammered O
the O
region O
. O

The O
sociologist O
Kyle O
Cleveland O
argues O
persuasively O
that O
Fukushima O
was O
a O
moral O
panic O
, O
in O
that O
the O
panic O
was O
motivated O
by O
a O
desire O
by O
the O
Japanese O
news O
media O
and O
public O
for O
revenge O
against O
an O
industrial O
and O
technical O
elite O

as O
uncaring O

arrogant O
, O

Seeing O

declare O

transcience O

To O

more O

to O
tease O

When O
pressed O
as O
to O
supposed O
safety O
advantages O
, O
advocates O
of O
radical O

often O
slip O

Slow O

, O
and O

what O
has O
made O

Not O
a O

nuclear O

would O
have O
said O
so O
at O
the O
time O
. O

But O
in O
the O
decades O
since O
, O
many O
of O

came O
to O
believe O
precisely O
that O
. O

In O
response O
to O
Three O
Mile O

, O
the O
nuclear O
industry O
stepped O
up O
training O
, O
checklists O
, O
and O
better O
oversight O
. O

The O
result O
was O
that O
nuclear O
plants O
in O
the O
U B-Location
. I-Location

. I-Location

went O
from O

percent O
of O
the O
time O

Anti O
- O
nuclear O
activists O
have O
long O
claimed O
that O
there O
is O
a O
trade O

off O
between O
nuclear O
safety O
and O
economics O
when O
it O
comes O
to O

the O

case O

Might O
Japanese B-Location
nuclear O
leaders O
look O
back O
on O
Fukushima O
the O
same O
way O
one O
day O
? O
That O
depends O
on O
what O
they O
do O
now O
. O

To O
date O
, O
Japanese B-Location
leaders O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
amends O
to O
the O
public O
for O
the O
Fukushima O
accident O
, O
but O
they O
' O
ve O
done O
so O
in O
ways O
that O
have O
reinforced O
the O
view O
of O
radiation O
as O
a O
super O
- O
potent O
toxin O
, O
and O
without O
building O
any O
greater O
trust O
in O
the O
technology O
. O

For O
decades O
, O
nuclear O
leaders O
in O
Japan B-Location
and O
the O
U B-Location
. I-Location

S I-Location
. I-Location

reinforced O
the O
notion O
that O
nuclear O
is O
an O
inherently O
dangerous O
technology O
, O
but O
one O
that O
they O
could O
control O
. O

When O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
they O
couldn O
' O
t O
control O
it O
, O
the O
public O
understandably O
assumed O
that O
they O
had O
been O
put O
in O
danger O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
in O
part O
, O
more O
reassuring O
. O

The O
radiant O
particulate O
matter O
that O
escapes O
from O
the O
worst O
nuclear O
accidents O
isn O
' O
t O
all O
that O
dangerous O
because O
there O
isn O
' O
t O
all O
that O
much O
of O
it O
. O

But O
another O
lesson O
is O
that O
humans O
are O
never O
in O
absolute O
control O
of O
our O
technologies O
. O

If O
we O
were O
, O
then O
nobody O
would O
die O
from O
exploding O
natural O
gas O
pipelines O
, O
plane O
crashes O
, O
or O
collapsed O
hydroelectric O

. O

The O
question O
is O
not O
how O
humans O
can O
gain O
absolute O
mastery O
, O
since O
that O
' O

impossible O
, O

rather O
which O
machines O

on O
balance O

deliver O
the O
most O
good O
with O
the O
least O
harm O

On O
that O
metric O

the O

that O
at O

the O
flooding B-Floods

not O

According O
to O
the O
Indian O

( O

) O
, O
monsoons O
in O
India B-Location
during O

Further O
, O
as O
per O
the O

, O

be O
well O
distributed O

Dean O
explained O
that O
Google's O
model O
simulates O
water O
behaviour O
across O
the O

, O
showing O
the O
areas O
that O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
affected O
. O

The O

combines O
thousands O

to O
create O
high O

elevation O
maps O
to O
figure O
out O

It O
then O
uses O

correct O
the O

, O
making O
it O
more O
accurate O
, O
after O
which O
it O
simply O
applies O

to O
simulate O
how O

happen O
. O

However O
, O
effective O
riverine O
flood B-Floods
forecasting O
at O
scale O
is O
hindered O
by O
a O
number O
of O
factors O
, O
with O
the O
biggest O
factor O
being O
the O
need O
to O
rely O
on O

in O
current O
methodology O
, O
limited O
amount O

Google O

A O

very O
big O

provides O
tremendous O
strength O

The O

U O
C O
Mohanty O

The O
super O

was O
accompanied O
with O
winds O
of O
speeds O
250-260 O

or O
more O

In O
comparison O
, O
Cyclone B-NaturalHazards
Fani O
had O
a O
pressure O
drop O
of O
63 O
milibars O

about O
210-215 O
km O

. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
context O
, O
the O
super O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
carried O
energy O
equivalent O
to O
1 O
, O
600 O
atomic O
bombs O
, O
similar O
to O
the O
ones O
dropped O
over O
Hiroshima B-Location
. O

Almost O
the O
entire O
coastline O
of O
Odisha B-Location
was O
affected O
, O
with O
the O
districts O
of O
Kendrapara B-Location
and O
Jagatsinghpur B-Location
worst O
off O
. O

Entire O
villages O
were O
washed O
off O
. O

One O
former O
official O
involved O
in O
rescue O
and O
relief O
claims O
that O
waves O
as O
high O
as O
40 O
feet O
were O
witnessed O
, O
and O
villages O
as O
far O
away O
as O
40 O
km O
from O
the O
coast O
submerged O
. O

Most O
documented O
accounts O
talk O
of O
waves O
25 O
to O
30 O
feet O
high O
. O

What O
added O
to O
the O
destructive O
capability O
of O
the O
super O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
was O
that O
it O
stayed O
on O
for O
unusually O
long O
even O
after O
making O
landfall O
. O

Usually O
, O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
dissipate O
in O
strength O
very O
fast O
after O
making O
contact O
with O
land O
. O

This O
is O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
moisture O
that O
feeds O
it O
over O
the O
ocean O
, O
and O
the O
friction O
provided O
by O
land O
and O
other O
structures O
on O
it O
. O

The O
super O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
, O
however O
, O
continued O
to O
retain O
the O
strength O
of O
a O
cyclonic B-NaturalHazards
storm I-NaturalHazards
even O
36 O
hours O
after O
landfall O
. O

Heavy B-NaturalHazards
rain I-NaturalHazards
continued O
for O
two O
days O
along O
the O
coastline O
. O

What O
also O
made O
the O
1999 B-Date
super O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
such O
a O
huge O
tragedy O
was O
India B-Location
' O
s O
ill-preparedness O
. O

The O
India O
Meteorological O
Department O
( O
IMD O
) O
had O
put O
up O
its O
first O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
detection O
, O
tracking O
and O
warning O
system O
in O
the O
1970 B-Date
s O
, O
thanks O
mainly O
to O
its O
then O
director O
general O
P O
Koteswaram O
, O
who O
got O
10 O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
detection O
radars O
installed O
along O
the O
coastline O
. O

But O
even O
in O
1999 B-Date
, O
the O
IMD's O
ability O
to O
forecast O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
was O
pretty O
rudimentary O
. O

The O
computing O
resources O
were O
severely O
limited O
, O
the O
models O
were O
crude O
and O
weak O
, O
Internet O
access O
was O
just O
beginning O
so O
communication O
with O
other O
global O
agencies O
took O
time O
, O
and O
the O
sort O
of O
international O
collaborations O
that O
we O
have O
now O
were O
sorely O
missing O
. O

According O
to O
an O
account O
published O
by O
S O
R O
Kalsi O
in O
the O
IMD's O
quarterly O
journal O
Mausam O
, O
the O
IMD O
had O
detected O
the O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
when O
it O
formed O
on O
2025-10-01 B-Date
00:00:00 I-Date
, O
near O
the O
Andaman B-Location
and O
Nicobar B-Location
Islands I-Location
. O

By O
the O
next O
day O
, O
the O
IMD O
had O
alerted O
the O
coastal O
states O
of O
Andhra B-Location
Pradesh I-Location
, O
Odisha B-Location
and O
West B-Location
Bengal I-Location
. O

But O
it O
did O
not O
have O
the O
capability O
to O
predict O
the O
exact O
trajectory O
of O
the O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
. O

Even O
a O
day O
before O
landfall O
, O
All O
India B-Location
Radio O
bulletins O
were O
saying O
that O
the O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
could O
be O
headed O
to O
West B-Location
Bengal I-Location
. O

The O
super O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
also O
took O
meteorologists O
by O
surprise O
. O

It O
gained O
strength O
quite O
suddenly O
a O
day O
before O
landfall O
. O

In O
that O
same O
account O
, O
Kalsi B-Location
mentions O
that O
the O
air O
pressure O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
fell O
by O
66 O
milibars O
in O
the O
24 O
hours O
preceding O
landfall O
. O

This O
indicates O
it O
was O
a O
case O
of O
rapid O
development O
, O
O
he O
says O
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
the O
state O
did O
not O
have O
the O
infrastructure O
or O
the O
resources O
to O
evacuate O
people O
, O
the O
most O
crucial O
difference O
between O
then O
and O
now O
. O

One O
study O
of O
the O
1999 B-Date
super O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
says O
there O
were O
barely O
75 O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
shelters O
in O
the O
entire O
coastline O
of O
Odisha B-Location
, O
all O
built O
by O
the O
Red O
Cross O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Barely O
any O
evacuations O
were O
made O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
thanks O
to O
standard O
operating O
procedures O
for O
evacuation O
now O
, O
almost O
2021-01-02 O
00:00:00 O

even O

a O
very O
large O

She O
grew O
up O

complicated O
relationship O
with O
the O
800-mile O
Cauca B-Location

Proponents O

long O
argued O
that O

though O

( O

Now O
it's O

EPM O

optimistic O
about O

believe O
that O

The O
Colombian O

released O
a O
scathing O
report O
in O

finding O
that O

ordering O
EPM O

. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
river's O
slower O
speed O
above O
the O

has O
allowed O
the O

choking O
out O

As O
the O
river O

the O
water O

Zuleta O
works O
full O

often O
results O
in O

Even O
during O

Despite O

irrigators O
like O
Mr O
Watson O
were O
able O
to O
use O
some O
of O
that O
water O
because O
they O
carefully O
saved O
it O
from O

We O
chose O
to O
save O

he O
said O

I O
find O
it O
a O
bit O
unfair O
that O
when O
it O

people O
want O

take O
that O

Water O

say O
that O

they O
prioritise O
people O

ahead O

Either O
way O

the O

, O
he O

Mr O

said O
that O
without O
irrigators O
storing O

in O

, O
the O
river O
would O
have O
run O
dry B-NaturalHazards
much O
sooner O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
releases O
from O
Keepit O

over O
the O
last O
two O
years O
, O
the O

been O
three O
times O

have O
occurred O
under O

We O
' O

had O

draining O
the O

to O
less O

1 O

she O

if O

all O
the O
argument O
over O

everyone O
wanted O
the O

thing: O
a O

system O
that O
could O
support O
all O
the O

that O
depended O

If O
we O
go O
over O

all O
our O

As O
part O
of O

The O
following O
day O
, O
the O
IMD O
said O
Cyclone B-NaturalHazards
Fani O
could O
cross O
the O

the O
afternoon O
of O
2003-05-01 B-Date

, O
and O
the O
NDRF O
started O
mobilising O

500 O

the O

The O
IMD O
later O
said O
the O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
would O
hit O
Puri B-Location
in O
the O
morning O
, O
as O
it O
eventually O
did O
. O

Fani O
was O
unusual O
because O
it O
was O
only O
the O
second O

since O
1891 B-Date
, O
out O

hit O
the O

triggered O
heavy B-NaturalHazards

in O
Andhra B-Location

West B-Location
Bengal I-Location
and O
also O

There O
was O
no O
fear O
we O
wouldn't O
be O
able O
to O
manage O
it O
. O

The O
very O
fact O
that O
not O
a O
single O
fisherman O
died O
at O
sea O
shows O
we O
were O
able O
to O
reach O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
sections O
of O

, O
O

the O

at O
the O

another O
long O
day O
for O
him O
. O

The O
50-year-old O

had O
first-hand O
experience O
of O

while O
growing O
up O

the O
coastal O
Balasore O

near O
the O

No O
one O
would O
tell O
us O
there O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
. O

Things O
are O
quite O
different O
now O
. O

O
The O
east O
coast O
of O
India B-Location
is O
way O
more O
vulnerable O
to O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
than O
the O
west B-Location
coast I-Location
, O
leaving O
states O
like O
Odisha B-Location
, O
West B-Location
Bengal I-Location

Ahead O

with O

the O

they O
booked O

only O

a O

two O

So O
we O
offered O

Sahoo O

With O
a O
sharp O
increase O

, O
The O
Crown O
had O
to O
inflate O
their O

bring O
down O
the O

Among O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
demand O

so O
high O

Three O

it O
became O
really O
difficult O
to O
live O
without O

. O

So O
our O
entire O
family O
, O
including O
my O
cousins O

, O
decided O
to O
move O

O
she O
told O

Patnaik O
returned O
home O
three O
days O
later O
when O
one O
of O
their O
family O
friends O
managed O
to O
purchase O
a O
generator O
from O
a O
neighbouring O
town O
. O

We O
had O
to O
purchase O
a O
diesel O
generator O
at O
double O
the O
price O
from O
Berhampur B-Location
because O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
even O
step O
inside O
any O
of O
the O
shops O
in O
Bhubaneswar B-Location
due O
to O
the O
high O

O
Even O
though O
The O
Crown O

cautioned O
the O
guests O
at O
the O
time O

check O
in O
that O

will O
have O
to O
stay O
without O

at O

two O

as O

Sahoo O
said O
that O

are O
happily O
agreeing O

it O

O
As O
most O

Bhubaneswar O

not O

Restoration O

O
said O
local O

Many O

Berhampur B-Location

in O
the O

too O
much O
rain O
keeps O
farmers O
from O

The O
unusually O
wet O

has O
affected O
farmers O
throughout O
the O

, O
but O
Illinois O
has O
been O
especially O
hard O
hit O
. O

Experts O
say O
with O
the O

so O
wet O
, O
heavy O

cold O
, O
it O
takes O
the O

away O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
if O
not O
impossible O
for O

to O
take O

. O

Right O
now O
, O
soil O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
entire O

is O
completely O
and O
utterly O

. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
very O
few O
Illinois O
farmers O
have O
been O
able O
to O
get O
corn O

about O
11% O

about O
4% O

Last O
year O
at O
this O
time O
, O
88% O
of O
corn O
and O
56% O
of O
soybeans O
were O
in O
the O

. O

I O
would O
use O
the O
word O
catastrophe O
to O
describe O
what O
Illinois O
farmers O
are O
facing O
, O
but O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
what O
they O
are O
going O
through O
is O
far O
beyond O
that O
. O

Normally O
, O
if O
corn O
farmers O
have O
a O
problem O
getting O
corn O
in O
the O
ground O
then O
they O
just O
switch O
to O
soybeans O
instead O
. O

But O
thanks O
to O
the O
trade O
war O
, O
soybean O
exports O
have O
plummeted O
dramatically O
, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
soybeans O
is O
the O
lowest O
that O
it O
has O
been O
in O
a O
decade O

As O
a O
result O
there O
is O
very O
little O
profit O
, O
if O
any O
, O
in O
growing O
soybeans O
this O
year O
Farmers O
in O
many O
parts O
of O
the O
corn O
belt O
have O
suffered O
from O
a O
wet O
and O
cooler O
spring O
, O
which O
has O
prevented O
them O
from O
planting O
corn O
. O

Typically O
when O
it O
becomes O
too O
late O
to O
plant O
corn O
, O
farmers O
will O
instead O
plant O
soybeans O
, O
which O
can O
grow O
later O

As O
many O
experts O
have O
argued O
, O
the O
approach O
to O
tackling O
natural O
disasters O
needs O
to O
be O
flipped O
altogether O
, O
with O
more O
money O
dedicated O
to O
preventing O
much O
of O
this O
damage O
from O
happening O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
rather O
than O
simply O
responding O
to O
it O

That O
far O
from O
how O
it O
currently O
works O
, O
though O
things O
have O
been O
improving O
. O

As O
it O
stands O
, O
Congress O
allocates O
annual O
disaster O
appropriations O
for O
agencies O
like O
FEMA O
, O
and O
one-off O
supplemental O
funding O
to O
provide O
extra O
support O
for O
each O
disaster O
as O
it O
happens O
. O

By O
green-lighting O
these O
supplemental O
funds O
after O
disasters O
have O
taken O
place O
, O
however O
, O
lawmakers O
are O
constantly O
swooping O
in O
once O
the O
damage O
has O
already O
been O
done O
. O

That O
what O
happening O
now O
, O
as O
the O
House O

tussle O
over O
how O

In O
the O

, O
the O
back-and-forth O
over O
the O
latest O

much-needed O
repairs O

, O
in O
the O

. O

In O
the O
long O
term O
, O
it O
a O
sign O
of O
just O
how O
much O
Congress O
needs O
to O
rethink O
the O
way O
it O
addresses O

” O
and O
disasters O
themselves O
. O

The O
current O
fight O
over O

centers O
on O
Trump O
aversion O
to O
helping O
Puerto B-Location

Congress O
is O
currently O
caught O
up O
in O
a O
spending O
battle O
over O

it O
largely O
because O
of O
President O

As O
Vox O
Tara O
Golshan O
reports O
, O
Democrats O
have O
pushed O
for O
additional O
funding O
to O

in O
the O
wake O
of O
Hurricane B-NaturalHazards

in O
2017 B-Date
, O
while O
Trump O
has O
sought O
to O
limit O
the O
aid O
. O

Trump O
longstanding O
aversion O
to O
helping O
Puerto B-Location

comes O
down O
to O
allegations O
he O
made O
, O
with O
no O

about O
the O

While O

also O
demanded O
$ O
4 O

5 O
billion O

for O
border-related O

, O
something O
that O
Democrats O
aren t O
exactly O
happy O
about O
. O

Ongoing O
conflict O
on O
both O
issues O
has O
caused O
significant O
delays O
, O
with O
residents O
across O
the O
country O
waiting O
on O
much-needed O
money: O
Four O
months O
after O
the O
House O
passed O
its O
first O
version O
of O
the O
latest O
disaster O
aid O
bill O
earlier O
this O
year O
, O
Congress O
still O
has O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
bipartisan O
agreement O
. O

I O
believe O
I m O
correct O
that O
this O
has O
taken O
longer O
than O
after O
any O
previous O
disaster O
to O
address O
the O
problem O
, O
Senate O
Majority O
Leader O
Mitch O
McConnell O
told O
reporters O
last O
week O
. O

The O
politicization O
of O
disaster O
aid O
” O
once O
considered O
a O
straightforward O
legislative O
ask O
” O
has O
been O
disheartening O
for O
some O
experts O
. O

The O
overall O
and O
most O
extraordinary O
problem O
to O
me O
is O
how O
much O
money O
for O
disasters O
on O
every O
level O
has O
been O
so O
incredibly O
politicized O
, O
says O
Irwin O
Redlener O
, O
the O
director O
of O
Columbia O
University O
National O
Center O
for O
Disaster O
Preparedness O
. O

While O
such O
fights O
haven t O
always O
been O
so O
partisan O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
recent O
conflict O
appears O
poised O
to O
solidify O
a O
new O
precedent O
that O
more O
and O
more O
common O
under O
divided O
government O
. O

As O
Senate O
leaders O
signaled O
this O
week O
, O
they O
plan O
to O
take O
another O
vote O
on O
an O
aid O
package O
later O
this O
month O
. O

That O
vote O
would O
come O
more O
than O
seven O
months O
after O
Hurricane B-NaturalHazards
Michael O
hit O
Florida B-Location
, O
over O
a O
year O
since O
Hurricane B-NaturalHazards
Maria O
hit O
Puerto B-Location
Rico I-Location
and O
multiple O
months O
after O
major O
flooding B-Floods
destroyed O
towns O
in O
the O
Midwest O
. O

Natural O
disasters O
are O
only O
expected O
to O
get O
worse O
, O
and O
aid O
funding O
isn t O
doing O
much O
to O
mitigate O
their O
impact O
According O
to O
climate O
scientists O
, O
the O
frequency O
and O
intensity O
of O
storms B-NaturalHazards
, O
wildfires B-NaturalHazards
, O
and O
flooding B-Floods
are O
increasing O
, O
in O
part O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
climate O
change O
. O

Many O
experts O
argue O
it O
no O
longer O
sufficient O
to O
simply O
respond O
to O
natural O
disasters O
when O
they O
happen O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
say O
we O
should O
take O
preemptive O
efforts O
that O
try O
to O
limit O
the O
amount O
of O
damage O
they O
may O
cause O
. O

Such O
moves O
could O
include O
rehabilitating O
dated O
infrastructure O
like O
levees O
, O
making O
sure O
buildings O
are O
up O
to O
modern O
codes O
and O
rebuilding O
in O
areas O
that O
may O
be O
less O
susceptible O
to O
flooding B-Floods
. O

Right O
now O
, O
however O
, O
the O
way O
the O
government O
approaches O
natural O
disasters O
is O
still O
extremely O
reactive O
. O

In O
2018 B-Date
, O
for O
example O
, O
Congress O
allocated O
$ O
249 O
million O
for O
hazard O
mitigation O
efforts O
aimed O
at O
preventing O
damage O
from O
future O
natural O
disasters O
, O
compared O
to O
nearly O
$ O
7 O
. O

4 O
billion O
it O
doled O
out O
to O
FEMA O
disaster O
relief O
fund O
overall O
. O

Additionally O
, O
although O
the O
federal O
government O
has O
funds O
set O
aside O
for O
reducing O
damage O
caused O
by O
natural O
disasters O
down O
the O
line O
, O
a O
huge O
chunk O
isn t O
accessible O
until O
an O
area O
has O
already O
been O
hit O
by O
a O
natural O
disaster O
, O
according O
to O
a O
September B-Date
2018 I-Date
analysis O
by O
Pew O
Charitable O
Trusts O
. O

While O
those O
funds O
are O
certainly O
helpful O
, O
they re O
basically O
only O
accessible O
after O
a O
major O
disaster O
has O
caused O
significant O
damage O
. O

If O
you O
think O
about O
the O
continuum O
of O
prevention O
, O
mitigation O
, O
response O
, O
and O
recovery O
, O
we re O
best O
at O
response O
, O
worse O
at O
recovery O
, O
and O
worst O
at O
prevention O
, O
Redlener O
says O
. O

The O
case O
for O
spending O
to O
rebuild O
after O
a O
disaster O
isn t O
driven O
by O
solely O
humanitarian O
aims O
"either;" O
there O
also O
political O
incentive O
for O
lawmakers O
to O
allocate O
more O
for O
relief O
than O
prevention O
. O

According O
to O
a O
FiveThirtyEight O
analysis O
, O
voters O
reward O
presidents O
for O
spending O
on O
relief O
, O
but O
not O
for O
spending O
on O
preparedness O
. O

The O
argument O
for O
spending O
more O
on O
mitigation O
, O
though O
not O
as O
self-evidently O
and O
immediately O
beneficial O
, O
has O
been O
proven O
by O
numerous O
studies: O
A O
review O
by O
National O
Institute O
of O
Building O
Sciences O
found O
that O
every O
$ O
1 O
invested O
in O
preventative O
efforts O
translated O
to O
$ O
6 O
saved O
in O
longer-term O
relief O
costs O
. O

It O
a O
dynamic O
that O
been O
consistent O
for O
some O
time O
, O
evidenced O
by O
the O
response O
to O
Hurricane B-NaturalHazards
Harvey O
in O
2017 B-Date
, O
Vox O
Ella O
Nilsen O
reported: O
The O
United B-Location
States I-Location
spends O
about O
$ O
300 O
billion O
responding O
to O
natural O
disasters O
like O
Hurricanes B-NaturalHazards
Harvey O
and O
Irma O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
we O
only O
spend O
about O
$ O
600 O
million O
on O
mitigation O
” O
improving O
buildings O
so O
they O
won t O
flood O
when O
the O
next O
storm O
comes O
. O

This O
is O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
mitigation O
has O
a O
4-1 O
payback O
, O
[ O
Larry O
] O
Larson O
, O
a O
[ O
a O
senior O
policy O
adviser O
at O
the O
Association O
of O
State O
Floodplain O
Managers O
] O
said O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
people O
often O
don t O
want O
to O
spend O
money O
upfront O
to O
protect O
their O
house O
or O
business O
, O
and O
then O
get O
caught O
up O
in O
a O
cycle O
of O
rebuilding O
. O

The O
strategy O
may O
have O
worked O
before O
, O
when O
natural O
disasters O
were O
flukes O
rather O
than O
more O
regular O
occurrences O
. O

But O
it O
falling O
short O
as O
climate O
change O
spurs O
an O
influx O
of O
everything O
from O
tropical O
storms B-NaturalHazards
to O
wildfires O
. O

The O
way O
that O
we re O
doing O
this O
is O
really O
not O
sustainable O
, O
says O
Ellen O
Vaughan O
, O
a O
policy O
director O
at O
the O
Environmental O
and O
Energy O
Study O
Institute O
. O

It O
really O
does O
beg O
the O
question O
for O
more O
investment O
in O
preventative O
measures O
, O
in O
mitigation O
, O
to O
make O
our O
communities O
and O
our O
infrastructure O
more O
resilient O
. O

Congress O
is O
starting O
to O
address O
the O
surge O
in O
natural O
disasters O
Lawmakers O
from O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
aisle O
have O
said O
they re O
interested O
in O
changing O
this O
process O
so O
that O
congressional O
budgets O
include O
more O
money O
for O
both O
disaster O
relief O
and O
mitigation O
. O

This O
would O
ensure O
states O
and O
cities O
are O
more O
ready O
to O
weather O
possible O
disasters O
and O
preempt O
the O
need O
for O
as O
many O
supplemental O
appropriations O
debates O
. O

One O
proposed O
effort O
would O
try O
to O
preemptively O
boost O
the O
disaster O
relief O
budget O
, O
so O
it O
not O
as O
dependent O
on O
extra O
appropriations O
midway O
through O
the O
year O
. O

This O
tactic O
, O
which O
is O
supported O
by O
senators O
like O
Mike O
Enzi O
( O
R-WY O
) O
, O
could O
help O
prevent O
fights O
like O
the O
ongoing O
one O
in O
the O
Senate B-Location
. O

Bolstering O
FEMA O
disaster O
funding O
would O
also O
acknowledge O
the O
degree O
of O
damage O
that O
natural O
disasters O
have O
begun O
to O
cause O
, O
though O
it O
would O
only O
really O
be O
tackling O
the O
logistics O
and O
timing O
behind O
the O
spending O
fights O
, O
and O
not O
so O
much O
the O
substance O
of O
how O
the O
money O
is O
used O
. O

Given O
the O
magnitude O
of O
these O
disasters O
, O
it O
probably O
makes O
sense O
to O
have O
more O
money O
planned O
to O
respond O
but O
I O
think O
that O
it O
a O

more O
to O
change O
the O

acknowledges O
just O
how O
important O
preventative O

are O
. O

These O

to O

hard O

not O
doing O
quite O
well O

In O
fact O
, O
one O
of O
the O
only O
struggling O
parts O

As O
you O

lost O
nearly O
20 O

soybeans O
, O
and O
with O
current O
stockpiles O
set O
to O
reach O

, O
the O
question O
is O
can O
soybean O

stabilize O
in O
2019 B-Date
, O
or O
is O
more O

, O

situation O
, O
and O
AFS O
situation O
in O

to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
soybean O
prices O
are O
heading O
lower O
still O
in O
2019 B-Date
! O
Over O
the O

the O

, O
and O
particularly O
China B-Location
' O
s O
insatiable O
demand O
for O
soybeans O
has O
been O
met O
by O
US B-Location
farmers O
. O

Even O
with O
record O
acres O
and O
production O
, O
soybean O
stockpiles O
have O
remained O
small O
in O
the O
US B-Location
because O
of O
Chinese B-Location
and O
world O
demand O
. O

However O
, O
following O
the O
implementation O
of O

and O
another O

current O

use O
ratio O
as O
seen O
below O
paint O
a O
bleak O
picture O
for O
2019 B-Date
. O

You O
can O
see O
above O
that O
US B-Location
soybean O
stockpiles O
have O
nearly O
doubled O
in O
the O
last O
10 O
years O
. O

The O
concerning O
part O
of O
the O
data O
above O
is O
that O

projected O
to O
be O
at O
levels O
not O
seen O
since O
2012 B-Date
. O

The O
other O
major O
concern O
regarding O
soybean O
supply O
moving O
forward O
is O
the O
projected O
acres O
for O
2019 B-Date

which O
results O
in O
the O
largest O

Soybeans O

and O
center O
of O
the O
US B-Location
/ O
China B-Location
trade O
negotiations O
. O

The O
biggest O
concern O
is O
what O
permanent O
impact O
tariffs O
will O
have O
on O
Chinese B-Location
purchasing O
strategies O
and O
behaviors O
for O

Below O
you O
can O
see O
just O
how O
much O
sales O
of O
US B-Location

has O
been O
lost O
to O
the O
Chinese B-Location
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
major O
sales O
were O
lost O
in O
January B-Date
and O
February B-Date
of O
this O
year O
, O
with O
the O
Chinese B-Location
only O
purchasing O
a O
third O
of O
the O
normal O
soybeans O
for O
that O
timeframe O
compared O
to O
the O
5 O
year O
average O
. O

The O
big O
concern O
is O
the O
majority O
of O
sales O
for O
the O
crop O
year O
that O
has O
been O
lost O
since O

are O
when O
the O
largest O
sales O
to O
China B-Location
occur O
during O
the O
crop O
year O
. O

Looking O
ahead O
, O
the O
major O
concern O
for O
US B-Location
soy O
producers O
should O
be O
the O
spread O
of O
ASF O
( O
African O
Swine O
Flu O
) O
throughout O
the O
Chinese B-Location
pig O
population O

While O
initially O
claiming O
it O
was O
contained O
, O
the O
virus O
has O
spread O
like O
wildfire O
across O
China B-Location
, O
wiping O
out O
more O
pigs O
than O
the O
entire O
US B-Location
pig O
population O
( O
over O
75 O
million O
hogs O
) O
. O

With O
monthly O
declines O
reaching O
5 O
- O
7 O
% O
for O
Chinese O
hog O
herds O
, O
this O
will O
result O
in O
direct O
demand O
destruction O
for O
US B-Location
soybeans O
, O
even O
if O
a O
trade O
deal O
is O
reached O
. O

More O
concerning O
is O
how O
long O
the O
virus O
continues O
to O
spread O
and O
impact O
not O
just O
China B-Location

all O
of O
Asia B-Location

With O
current O

to O
suggest O
more O
rain O
in O
the O
Midwest O
for O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
, O
it O
' O

likely O
that O

acres O
will O
increase O
in O
2019 B-Date

Fundamentally O
, O
prices O
for O

most O

This O
year O
we O
' O

only O
probably O
had O
about O
10 O

has O
been O
saved O
from O

made O
in O
O O

. O

But O
that O
water O
came O
from O
the O
last O
flow O
down O
the O
Namoi O
River O
, O
released O
from O
Keepit O

. O

And O
both O
are O
now O
all O
but O
dry B-NaturalHazards
. O

Mr O
Langdon O
said O
that O
without O
irrigators O
storing O
water O
in O
Keepit O
Dam O
, O
the O
river O
would O
have O
run O
dry B-NaturalHazards
much O
sooner O
. O

Annie O

, O
was O
among O
those O
who O
advocated O
to O
keep O
more O

in O
the O

through O
the O
drought B-NaturalHazards
. O

Professor O
Thoms O
said O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
argument O
over O
management O
of O
the O
Murray B-Location
- I-Location
Darling I-Location
Basin O
, O
everyone O
wanted O
the O
same O
thing O
: O
a O
resilient O
system O
that O
could O
support O
all O
the O
life O
that O
depended O
on O
it O
. O

Professor O

from O
the O
Australian O
Rivers O
Institute O
at O
Queensland O
' O
s O
Griffith O
University O
, O
said O
that O
while O
the O
rivers O
in O
the O
Murray B-Location
- I-Location
Darling I-Location
region O
did O
naturally O
stop O
flowing O
in O
dry B-NaturalHazards
times O
, O
they O
were O
under O
enormous O
stress O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

Professor O
Sheldon O
said O
the O
state O
of O
the O
river O
was O
caused O
by O
the O
drought B-NaturalHazards
, O
but O
water O
extraction O
was O
also O
playing O
a O
role O
. O

She O
said O
when O
the O
drought B-NaturalHazards
did O
break O
, O
the O
first O
major O
flows O
down O
this O
river O
system O
needed O
to O
be O
protected O
to O
help O
the O
river O
recover O
. O

Professor O
Sheldon O
said O
adaptive O
management O
was O
required O
while O
everyone O
waited O
to O
see O
what O
the O
Murray B-Location
- I-Location
Darling I-Location
Basin O
Plan O
could O
deliver O
when O
more O
water O
returned O
to O
the O

Boggabri B-Location

Andrew O
Watson O
doesn O

The O
recent O
occurrence O
of O
Cyclone B-NaturalHazards
Idai O
and O
Cyclone B-NaturalHazards
Kenneth O
, O
striking O
Mozambique B-Location
and O
Malawi B-Location
in O
March B-Date
and O
April B-Date
this O
year O
respectively O
, O
has O
raised O
concerns O
about O
the O
possibilities O
of O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
making O
landfalls O
in O
Africa B-Location
. O

There O
is O
anxiety O
about O
where O
a O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
is O
likely O
to O
hit O
next O
or O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

But O
what O
is O
a O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
? O
A O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
is O
a O
large O
air O
mass O
that O
rotates O
around O
a O
centre O
of O
low O
atmosphere O
pressure O
. O

In O
meteorological O
lingo O
, O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
are O
called O
depressions O
or O
storms B-NaturalHazards
. O

The O
majority O
of O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
are O
also O
called O
hurricanes B-NaturalHazards
, O
but O
they O
have O
other O
names O
given O
according O
to O
areas O
where O
they O
occur O
. O

The O
names O
include O
typhoons O
in O
West B-Location
- I-Location
north I-Location
Pacific I-Location
, O
Willy B-Location
- I-Location
willies I-Location
in O
Australia B-Location
, O
hurricanes B-NaturalHazards
in O
North B-Location
and I-Location
Central I-Location
America I-Location
or I-Location
Baguios I-Location
in O
the O
Philippines B-Location
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
name O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
is O
in O
reference O
to O
those O
that O
are O
formed O
in O
the O
Indian B-Location
Ocean I-Location
. O

This O
heat O
is O
the O
source O
of O
energy O
for O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
formation O
and O
the O
ocean O
waters O
is O
the O
source O
of O
moisture O
. O

For O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
to O
form O
, O
the O
surface O
temperature O
of O
the O
water O
has O
to O
be O
27 O
degrees O
centigrade O
or O
above O
. O

Most O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
originate O
on O
either O
side O
of O
the O
low O
pressure O
zone O
around O
the O
equator O
called O
the O
Intertropical O
Convergence O
Zone O
. O

Objects O
( O
air O
included O
) O
will O
be O
deflected O
to O
the O
right O
in O
Northern B-Location
hemisphere I-Location
and O
to O
the O
left O
in O
Southern B-Location
hemisphere I-Location
. O

Once O
cyclones B-NaturalHazards
are O
formed O
they O
are O
always O
mobile O
, O
following O
irregular O
paths O
or O
tracks O
within O
the O
general O
flow O
of O
trade O
winds O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
predict O
a O
specific O
cyclone B-NaturalHazards
path O
in O
advance O
, O
but O
the O
general O
path O
is O
highly O
predictable O
depending O
on O
where O
they O
form O
in O
the O
ocean O
. O
